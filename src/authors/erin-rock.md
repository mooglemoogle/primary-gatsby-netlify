  Erin considers her interest in history too widely varied for her to be called
  an expert on anything, unfortunately. She earned a Bachelorâ€™s of Arts Degree
  in History at the University of Florida. She is currently a Historian and
  Event Coordinator at a historic house museum in Northern Virginia.
