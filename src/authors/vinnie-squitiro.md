subtitle: 'Co-Host, Not Historian'
description: >-
  Vinnie is an anomaly, expressing an infectious enthusiasm for history while
  knowing little by his own admission. Donâ€™t ask him to name all the presidents,
  but he can tell you every detail about every episode of Gilmore Girls. When
  not working on Primary, Vinnie can often be found playing Final Fantasy.
